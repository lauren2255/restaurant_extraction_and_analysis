# Restaurant Data Extraction and Analysis
Restaurant data was extracted and analyzed according to the following specifications:

## Specifications & Instructions
### Step 1: Extract Location Data
The Project Manager in charge of this case has identified a URL (
https://lamadeleine.com/locations
) that contains the data we hope to target.
Your objective is to extract all locations across the United States. While there is not a definitive method or approach to do so, the Project Manager mentioned that there may be an API call available that contains all US locations in a single network request.
Leveraging your knowledge of JavaScript, Python, and network APIs, programmatically extract the following fields into a CSV or XSLX file:
- locationName
- streetAddress
- city
- state
- postalCode
- phoneNumber
- storeID

### Step 2: Association with Reviews
With the provided Google Reviews and location data you extracted, use any method of your choice to relate the two datasets together. This relationship is imperative, as we need to gain insights about the Google Reviews on a location by location basis.

### Step 3: Create Slide with Insights
Draft a single slide presentation using PowerPoint, Google Slides, or another slide deck software of your choice to highlight your insights. We are not looking for any insight in particular, so tell us about anything you think is interesting! In your slide, please include a visual as well as high-level text descriptions to illustrate your point.
